## Shortener
A class that for every string (value) will return a unique identifier and vice versa

## Requirements 
Should always return corresponding key/value depending on what have been
passed to it. 
Support as many strings as many long can accept (long type will be used for identifier)
Several approaches will be implemented by using Strategy pattern.
Include tests.

## Results and achievements
Repeat Strategy pattern usage
Create needed tests for more convenient testing of application
